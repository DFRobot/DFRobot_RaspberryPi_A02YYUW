## Summary

This is a Ranging sensor library based on python, its features:
 
1. Set the range of ranging：0~4500mm. 
2. Get ranging distance. 

## Installation
1. To use this library, first download the library file<br>
```python
sudo git clone https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_RaspberryPi_A02YYUW
```
2. Open and run the routine. To execute a routine demo_x.py, enter python demo_x.py in the command line. For example, to execute the demo_get_distance.py routine, you need to enter :<br>

```python
python demo_get_distance.py 
or
python2 demo_get_distance.py
or
python3 demo_get_distance.py
```

## Methods

```python
  '''
    @brief    set distance range.
    @param min: Minimum ranging distance
    @param max: Maximum ranging distance
    @note condition: min < max
  '''
  def set_dis_range(self, min, max):
      
  '''
    @brief    Get measured distance
    @return    measured distance
  '''
  def getDistance(self):
